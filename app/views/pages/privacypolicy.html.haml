%h1 Privacy policy
%p
  %em As of March 2022.
%p We are committed to protecting the privacy of users of the site.
%p
  This policy explains what information we gather when you visit our website, and explains
  how that information is used.
%p
  We occasionally update this Policy, so please do return and review this Policy from time to time.
  We also welcome any suggestions for improvements to this policy or its wording.
%h2 Identifying yourself to other users
%p
  We provide privacy controls that enable you to avoid your name being shown publicly on the internet while still
  visible to fellow members in a discussion. These are available on the
  #{link_to 'account details', edit_user_registration_path } page, and consist of two fields:
%ul.bullets
  %li your real name (visible to members of groups you are in); and
  %li an optional display name (for all other situations); if you don't set one, you'll be shown as anonymous.
%p The visibility rule described above is used whenever your name is shown to others, e.g.:
%ul.bullets
  %li next to each posting you make;
  %li in the list of people subscribed to a discussion thread; and
  %li on your user profile.
%p
  As the site is intended for collaborative discussion and working, we think it is helpful to your
  colleagues to use your real name when identifying yourself. Some groups using the site operate
  discussions on a real-names basis, so they may require that you identify yourself by your real name.
%p
  When starting a discussion thread, a group member can choose whether to make the discussion public or
  private to the group. The thread page includes a list of people subscribed to the discussion.
%p
  Note however that administrators of a group always have access to your real name and e-mail address,
  for example so that they can administer the membership list of the group effectively.
%h2 Your user profile
%p
  In order to foster a sense of community, we provide each member of the site with a user profile.
  This shows only the details you have chosen to enter on the
  #{link_to 'Edit my profile', current_user_profile_edit_path } page.
%p
  You can disable your user profile at any time (again via the
  #{link_to 'Edit my profile', current_user_profile_edit_path } page), so that it is not visible to others.
%p
  You can delete your account at any time by clicking on your username and then clicking 'Update my account details'.
%h2 Cookies
